üñ•Ô∏è Computer Vision Project

Developed a real-time video processing application with Python and OpenCV, demonstrating core image processing techniques and virtual camera integration.

üöÄ Features

Real-time video processing

Histogram equalization, filters, and RGB channel analysis

Face keypoint detection using pre-trained models

Replace detected faces with custom images

Output frames via pyvirtualcam as a virtual camera

Compatible with Zoom, Discord, and other VoIP apps

üß± Project Structure

Replaces detected faces with custom images

3Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Camera Output

Sends processed frames to a virtual camera using pyvirtualcam

Enables use in video conferencing apps

4Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Code

Well-commented Python scripts

Clear instructions for setup and usage

üß™ Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher

OpenCV

pyvirtualcam
